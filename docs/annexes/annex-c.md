# Annex C (Informative): MACsec Test Vectors

- Provides integrity and confidentiality test vectors for various frame lengths (54, 60, 65, 79, etc.).
- Each subsection lists plaintext frames, keys, nonces (PN/SCI), resulting Secure Data, and ICVs for GCM-AES-128/256 and XPN variants.
- Use these vectors to verify Cipher Suite implementations during interoperability testing.
- Tables C-1 through C-48 will be recreated in Markdown spreadsheets or CSVs in a later cleanup pass.
